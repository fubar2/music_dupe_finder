# music_dupe_finder
Small script to find duplicate sized audio files in my collection
Probably useless for anyone else
I had dupes with variable handling of unicode characters in filenames after 10 years of collecting
This *worked for me (TM)*
Used Levenshtein distances as a fuzzy comparator - might be useful if that's what ails ye.
